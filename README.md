![This is the code we used. We had a list of memes and a list of cats which we used to pass through when you clicked buttons and make annoying sounds sometimes.](https://github.com/MaxWelec94/Android/raw/master/codepicture.PNG)
[We also used clocks and an acceleramator along with donkey lists to make super annoying sounds. The clock and the acceleromator was used to make more buttons appear](https://github.com/MaxWelec94/Android/raw/master/codepicture2.PNG)
